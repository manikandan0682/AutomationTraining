# Python guessing game
Let's develop a game! 

In this lab you will use the things we've learned so far to develop a simple guessing game.

Objectives: 

* Create a script that does the following:
  * Randomly generates a number
  * Prompts the user to guess the number 
  * If the number provided is equal to the generated number, output "You win!"
  * If the number provided is smaller than the generated number, output "You're thinking too small."
  * If the number provided is larger than the generated number, output "You're thinking too large."
  * No matter what numbers they guess, end after five attempts



## Bonus

* Update the game to give the user the generated number at the end of their five attempts.




## Congrats!
